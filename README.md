# OLED Guard

An [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) shell plugin that stops your status bar from
out-wearing the rest of your OLED panel.

## The problem

OLED wear is luminance integrated over time. On a desktop, almost every pixel
gets shuffled constantly — windows move, text scrolls, workspaces switch. One
surface does not: the bar. The clock, the tray icons, the workspace pills sit in
the same physical pixels for the entire life of the session. Over enough hours
that strip simply ages faster than the panel around it, and the result is a
faint permanent band across the top of the screen.

Manufacturer guidance for this is consistent and boring: hide static UI, keep
brightness sane, let the screen switch off. OLED Guard covers the case those
leave open — the hours you are actually *using* the machine and want the bar
visible.

## What it does

Holds a translucent veil over the bar strip, and only the bar strip.

- **Continuous attenuation** (`baseOpacity`) — a standing reduction in how hard
  the bar's pixels are driven while you work.
- **Idle attenuation** (`idleOpacity`) — deepens once the mouse has not passed
  over the bar for `idleAfterSeconds`, and lifts when it passes over again.
- **Fullscreen suspend** — the veil lifts entirely when there is fullscreen
  content underneath. Dimming a film is a bug, not a feature. Decided per
  monitor, so a film on one screen is not veiled because another screen
  happens to hold focus.
- **Reveal on hover** (`revealOnHover`) — the veil clears the instant the
  pointer reaches the bar, the way Omarchy's own indicators reveal themselves.
  This is the setting that makes deep attenuation practical.

It follows the bar: change `bar.position` to `left` and the veil moves to the
left edge, resize the bar and the veil resizes with it. Hide the bar entirely
and the veil stops drawing, because there is nothing left to protect.

## Two attenuation modes

**Flat dim** (default) applies uniform alpha across the strip.

**Checkerboard** (`"checkerboard": true`) paints two stacked veils: a flat floor
across the whole strip, plus a shallow checker of depth `checkerContrast` over
half of it, rotating so the pattern cannot etch itself in. The floor carries
whatever attenuation the checker does not, so the delivered average always
equals what you asked for.

**It is a look, not a protection level — and it protects slightly worse.**

Both modes deliver the same *average*; they differ only in how it is
distributed. Under a linear wear model that is identical. OLED ageing is
superlinear in drive level, and for a convex wear curve the average of two
extremes exceeds the middle. Modelling wear as `L^γ`, the penalty depends
**only** on the checker depth `k` — the floor term cancels out of the ratio
entirely:

| checker depth `k` | penalty vs flat (γ=2) |
|---|---|
| 0 — flat dim | +0.0% |
| 0.10 | +0.3% |
| **0.25 — the default** | **+2.0%** |
| 0.50 | +11.1% |
| 1.00 | +100% |

Which is why the floor exists. Painting the checker at `2a` with no floor also
hits the average, and is what this plugin used to do — it cost 11% and left
half the pixels at *full* drive. A floor plus `k=0.25` costs 2% for the same
average and the same visible texture, and caps peak drive well below 100%.

### Why "let the pixel rest" does not rescue it

The natural defence is that the covered pixels get to rest. They do — but rest
is not free. Holding the average fixed, you cannot darken one half without
brightening its partner:

| checker `k` | covered drive | uncovered drive |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00 | 0.750 | 0.750 |
| 0.25 | 0.643 | 0.857 |
| 0.50 | 0.500 | **1.000** |

The covered half only reaches 0.50 because the uncovered half was pushed to
full. The rest is funded by overdriving the neighbour, and superlinear wear
charges more for the overdrive than it refunds for the rest. Every step toward
a softer checker is a step *toward flat dim*, which is why the curve is
monotonic with no interior optimum.

This holds because off-time *pauses* wear accumulation rather than reversing
it. If it reversed damage the conclusion would flip — which is true for the
transient charge-trapping component, and not for the permanent emitter
degradation that actually produces burn-in.

**If you want more protection, raise Depth.** That darkens every pixel. Reaching
for texture to get protection pays a wear penalty for something Depth gives you
for free.

So what is it for? Texture, and one real side effect: the covered and uncovered
halves differ in drive, so per-pixel contrast varies across the strip in a way a
flat dim does not produce. That is an aesthetic property. It reads as intended
at display scale 1, where the eye integrates the pattern spatially; at scale 2
the cells are 2x2 physical pixels and you simply see texture.

It lives under **LOOK** in the panel, not under PROTECTION, for that reason.

### Rotation is mandatory, not a bonus

The phase rotates every `checkerPhaseMinutes` because without it the
checkerboard would etch its own pattern into the strip -- a permanent
half-brightness grid, caused entirely by the mode meant to prevent burn-in.
Flat dim never creates that problem, so it needs no fix. Rotation is checker
solving something only checker causes; it is not extra protection on top.

The tile is opaque on its diagonal, so it has exactly **two** distinct states,
not four: offsetting by (1,1) maps black onto black and reproduces the original.
An earlier four-step walk rendered P, P', P', P -- even total time, so wear
levelling still held, but each state was held for two consecutive intervals and
the effective period was double the setting. It now alternates strictly.

Rotation genuinely wins where you *cannot* dim: a shader can only switch pixels
fully on or off, so rotating which ones are off is the only lever available.
That is hyproled's situation, and why the technique exists there.

One remaining limit: **the cell size follows your display scale.** The tile is
2x2 *logical* pixels, so at scale 2 each cell covers a 2x2 block of physical
pixels rather than one. Coverage is still 50% and rotation still swaps the
covered set completely, so the arithmetic holds, but the texture is coarser
than a true one-pixel checker. At fractional scales (1.25, 1.5) nearest
neighbour scaling makes cells uneven and the equal-time property degrades.

The old 50% ceiling is gone: because the floor absorbs whatever depth the
checker cannot carry, the delivered average now equals the request at any
depth.

Flat dim is available at all here only because this is a compositing layer. The
existing Hyprland tool in this space,
[hyproled](https://github.com/mklan/hyproled), uses a checkerboard shader
because a shader can only switch pixels fully off — it has no way to ask for
"70% as bright". A QML overlay can, which is why the default here is the mode
hyproled could not offer.

## Reveal on hover

A bar you have to read at a glance can only be dimmed so far. A bar that clears
the moment you reach for it can sit far darker the rest of the time — which is
a different order of saving, and strictly better than hiding the bar outright
because there is nothing to discover and nothing to undo.

Measured on a `#c2c2c2` bar at the **Veiled** depth:

| pointer | delivered attenuation | peak drive |
|---|---|---|
| away from the bar | 0.85 | **33 / 255** |
| on the bar | 0 | 194 / 255 |

Six times less peak drive, with the bar fully legible whenever you actually
look at it.

The two directions are timed differently on purpose. Clearing the veil answers
a gesture you just made, so it has to feel immediate; putting it back is
unprompted, so it should be slow enough that you never catch it happening. A
single duration forces a choice between a sluggish reveal and a visibly
blinking bar. Measured peak drive on the bar:

| transition | ~100 ms | ~250 ms | settled |
|---|---|---|---|
| clearing | 55 / 255 | — | 194 / 255 |
| veiling back | 194 / 255 | 194 / 255 | 33 / 255 |

Clearing ramps immediately; veiling holds and then eases down, so the bar never
appears to blink when you glance away.

Fullscreen counts as a reveal too, and uses the fast path: a film just started,
and leaving a veil across the top of it for a second and a half is the bug the
suspend exists to prevent.

It grabs no input: the plugin probes the global cursor against the live bar
geometry, while its overlay sits on top with an empty input region, so pointer
events pass straight through to the bar underneath. There is no second hover
surface and no click interception.

The **Veiled** depth preset (85% working, 90% idle) exists for this mode and is
not really usable without it.

## What this plugin deliberately does not do

**It does not orbit or nudge the bar.** Pixel-shift is the reflex suggestion
for burn-in, and for a status bar it is largely theatre: sliding a uniform
block two pixels sideways only changes the two-pixel edge, while the static
block stays exactly as static. It also isn't available — a plugin cannot
translate another plugin's layer-shell surface. Reducing how hard the strip is
driven attacks the actual wear term; moving it slightly does not.

**It is not a replacement for the boring advice.** Lower brightness and a short
display-off timeout beat this plugin on effort-to-benefit. Do those first. And
worth keeping in proportion: a
[3000-hour burn-in test](https://www.notebookcheck.net/3000-hour-LG-OLED-monitor-burn-in-test-reveals-minor-defects-with-Overwatch-2-a-culprit.1221804.0.html)
found modern panels hold up well, with damage concentrated in high-contrast
static elements. A status bar is exactly that shape, which is why this exists —
but it is insurance, not an emergency.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/roubilibo/omarchy-oled-guard.git --enable
```

Then restart the shell so the plugin's JS library loads:

```bash
omarchy restart shell
```

Enabling adds an entry to `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`. The plugin ships both
a background service and an optional bar indicator, and reads its config from
whichever entry exists — the `bar.layout` entry if you enabled the widget, or a
`plugins[]` entry if you want the service without the indicator.

## Removing it

```bash
omarchy plugin remove roubilibo.oled-guard
```

That unloads the service, drops the veil immediately, and removes the bar entry
from `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`. A timestamped copy of the plugin directory
is left in `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/` in case you want it back; delete it at
your leisure. Nothing is written anywhere else — no state files, no dotfiles, no
system configuration.

To keep it installed but inert, set `"enabled": false`, or press **Off** in the
panel.

## Configuration

All keys are optional; the defaults below are what you get with an empty entry.

```jsonc
{
  "id": "roubilibo.oled-guard",

  "enabled": true,             // false disables without uninstalling
  "level": "medium",           // active preset: light|medium|deep|veiled
  "levels": {
    "light":  { "baseOpacity": 0.10, "idleOpacity": 0.40 },
    "medium": { "baseOpacity": 0.15, "idleOpacity": 0.55 },
    "deep":   { "baseOpacity": 0.25, "idleOpacity": 0.75 },
    "veiled": { "baseOpacity": 0.85, "idleOpacity": 0.90 }
  },                           // edit these values to tune each preset
  "baseOpacity": 0.15,         // resolved value; kept for old configs
  "idleOpacity": 0.55,         // resolved value; `levels` wins when level exists
  "idleAfterSeconds": 90,      // 5-3600 seconds without mouse over the bar
  "fadeMs": 700,               // veiling back: gradual, so you never catch it
  "revealMs": 170,             // clearing: fast, it answers a gesture

  "checkerboard": false,       // true adds the rotating texture over the floor
  "checkerPhaseMinutes": 5,    // 1-720
  "checkerContrast": 0.25,     // 0.05-1  depth of the checker layer. This alone
                               // sets the wear penalty; 0.25 costs ~2%.

  "revealOnHover": false,      // clear the veil while the pointer is on the bar
  "hoverOpacity": 0.0,         // 0.0-0.9  attenuation while hovered

  "suspendOnFullscreen": true  // lift the veil over fullscreen content
}
```

Installing it starts you at **Medium** — a 15% standing reduction that is easy
to stop noticing, deepening to 55% after 90 seconds without the mouse passing over the bar. A plugin whose job is to
attenuate the bar should do that on install rather than sit inert until
configured. One click on **Off** in the panel stops it entirely.

Changes made through the panel, the `omarchy-shell roubilibo.oled-guard ...`
commands, or a `levels` edit in `shell.json` are applied as one normalized
snapshot to the widget, service and `shell.json`; no shell restart is needed.
The panel tooltips read the live numbers from that same snapshot. Editing the
plugin's source still requires `omarchy restart shell` because plugin code is
cached.

## Bar indicator and panel

A Nerd Font shield matching the first-party bar indicators: half-full while
attenuating, outline while standing by, struck through when paused.

**Left click opens a panel** — level, reveal behaviour and look, so nothing here
needs hand-editing `shell.json`. **Right click** pauses and resumes without
opening anything.

```
  LEVEL    Off  ·  Light  ·  Med  ·  Deep  ·  Veil
  REVEAL   Always on  ·  On hover
  LOOK     Flat  ·  Checker
```

Three rows, no prose. Off is the bottom of the intensity scale rather than a
separate axis, and every explanation lives in a tooltip -- a settings panel that
argues with you is a settings panel you stop opening.

LOOK is a separate section on purpose. Sitting in the protection row, Checker
read as a third and strongest setting — the opposite of true.

Levels are presets rather than raw opacities, because "how protected do you want
to be" is the question people actually have. Edit the four entries under
`levels` in `shell.json`; the panel labels and tooltips update from those
values. The percentages are working and idle respectively.

Hiding the bar outright is still the theoretical maximum, and Omarchy already
ships it at **Super + Ctrl + O → Menu Bar**. It is deliberately not duplicated
here: it would remove the surface its own control lives on, and Reveal on hover
gets most of the way there with nothing to discover and nothing to undo.

This panel is the one file that imports Omarchy's internal `qs.*` UI module, so
it matches every other dropdown. The service and the overlay stay
dependency-free — if a future Omarchy release moves that module, the indicator
is what breaks, never the guarding.

## Control

```bash
omarchy-shell oledguard status    # JSON: state and geometry
omarchy-shell oledguard pause     # lift the veil for now
omarchy-shell oledguard resume
omarchy-shell oledguard toggle
```

The panel exposes the same choices, so they can go on a keybinding:

```bash
omarchy-shell roubilibo.oled-guard level off|light|medium|deep|veiled
omarchy-shell roubilibo.oled-guard mode off|dim|checker   # sets power and look at once
omarchy-shell roubilibo.oled-guard reveal always|hover
omarchy-shell roubilibo.oled-guard look flat|checker
omarchy-shell roubilibo.oled-guard depth light|medium|deep
omarchy-shell roubilibo.oled-guard toggle   # open/close the panel
omarchy-shell roubilibo.oled-guard state
```

Pause is deliberately not persisted — it means "not right now". For "not ever",
set `"enabled": false`.

## What it does not keep

There is no running tally of light saved. An earlier version tracked one, and it
was the single worst part of the plugin: it accrued "wear avoided" against a
locked screen, it banked attenuation the checkerboard never actually delivered,
and it sampled once a minute at whatever value happened to be live on the tick —
which got materially wronger once hover-reveal started flipping attenuation
several times a minute.

Every one of those was fixable. None of them was worth fixing, because the
number was never actionable: nobody changes anything on being told "13m
reclaimed". The figures worth trusting are the measured ones in this README —
peak drive, wear penalties, contrast ratios — and those do not need a counter
running in your shell to stay true.

## Known limitations

- **Multi-monitor is unverified.** Fullscreen is resolved per screen, against
  each overlay's own monitor rather than one global flag, specifically so a film
  on one display is not veiled because another holds focus. That logic is
  correct by construction and verified against live Hyprland state — but only on
  a single-display machine. The multi-head path has never actually run. If you
  hit a problem there, please open an issue; it is the one thing here I could
  not test.
- **Checkerboard degrades at fractional scaling.** The tile is 2x2 logical
  pixels, so at 1.25 or 1.5 nearest-neighbour scaling makes the cells uneven and
  the equal-time property weakens. Flat is unaffected, and is the default.
